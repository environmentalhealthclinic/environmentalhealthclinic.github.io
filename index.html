                    <p>
                        The <a href="/project/phenclock.html">Phenological Clock</a> is a project that seeks to display and serve local phenological data in a beautiful and functional manner. <strong>Phenology</strong> is the study of periodic plant and animal life cycle events and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate, as well as habitat factors <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenology">[Wikipeadia/Phenology]</a></sup>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project consists of three main sub-projects. The Phenological Clock API, Phenological web display script and the Phenological Clock Processing script. Both scripts pull data from a schema defined by the API and display them for web and print respectively. The general idea being that local environments can record data into a standard format which can then be beautifully rendered for web or print.
                    </p>
                    <p>This project seeks to create a framework to better represent and connect people with their environments. Each Phenological Clock is a visual representation of a single year within an region. It represents the flow of life through the seasons in a visual manner.</p>
